                                       I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course,

                                can only say wonderful things<br> about the program.The entire<br> curriculum and staff did not <br>disappoint. 
                                The were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team project, in<br> particular,
                                was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>fact.
                                I've often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> development experience. It certainly <br>helped me land 
                                a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple <br>offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
